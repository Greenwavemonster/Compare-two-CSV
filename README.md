# Compare-two-CSV  (WIP)

Okay so, three things:

1. Welcome :)
2. Im *not* a professional, so the code is not perfect
3. The Script (var, methods etc.) are in german because i am so yeah....

About the Script:
------------------
We (Me & three friends) had to create this for a project work at our school. 

*Functionality:*  

SHORT:
* The script finds redundant addresses in a CSV2 based on CSV1
* If CSV2 contains Addresses which are NOT in CSV1, idk the scipt might ignore them or throw a error
* NOTE: You have to either rename all the var's in the Script to match your CSV's or the other way around (But they have to be in the correct order!)
* Everything is coded and (beautifully) commented in german (I you reeeaaalllyyy need a english version I can adapt it)

LONG:

When calling the Script you can feed it with two CSV-Files (See "Run Script"), which will then be compared. We had two CSV's which both contained 9999 Adresses. In CSV1 all addresses were unique, on CSV2 *not*. The Script then compared the two Files and generates a CSV3 were all redundant addresses from CSV2 are listed (based on the CSV1).

THIS MEANS:  
* This script is only to find redundandt adresses in a second CSV
* If CSV2 contains Addresses which are NOT in CSV1, idk the scipt might ignore them or throw a error
